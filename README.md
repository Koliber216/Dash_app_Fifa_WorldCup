# Dash_app_Fifa_WorldCup

This project was done during December 2022 and in was done using Dash library to create interactive Dashboards with Python. 
I used the data from kaggle [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brenda89/fifa-world-cup-2022?resource=download) and for each nation I visualized 
their statistics when it comes to their soccer games.
